![Premier League Logo](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Premier_League_Logo.svg/1200px-Premier_League_Logo.svg.png)

## Overview

This interactive Streamlit application analyzes "The Home Field Advantage Evolution in European Soccer" across three distinct periods: Pre-COVID, During COVID, and Post-COVID. The app visualizes how crowd support influences various match performance indicators during these periods.

Using data from top European leagues (Premier League, La Liga, Bundesliga, Serie A, and Ligue 1), the application provides comprehensive insights into how home advantage changed when matches were played in empty stadiums during the pandemic.

## Features

- **Real-time Data**: Fetches current football data from professional APIs (football-data.org and API-Football)
- **Period Analysis**: Compares match statistics across Pre-COVID, During-COVID, and Post-COVID periods
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Explore correlations between attendance and performance metrics
- **Team-specific Analysis**: Filter analysis by specific teams to examine their home advantage evolution
- **Database Integration**: Local SQLite database for efficient data retrieval and caching
- **Data Dictionary**: Comprehensive explanations of football metrics for users new to the sport
